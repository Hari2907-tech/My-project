RECOMMENDATION OF PESTICIDES BASED ON PEST CLASSIFICATION USING DEEP LEARNING

Description
In this approach, deep learning algorithms are trained on large datasets of labelled images of healthy and pest-infested crops,enabling them to identify and classify pests with high accuracy.

Features
Identify and classify pests with high accuracy,predict the fertilizers or pesticides based on identified pest.

Pest Recognition:Identify,classify pests and predict the fertilizers.
